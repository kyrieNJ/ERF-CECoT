## Detailed instructions for labeling
For annotation of the C2D2-EMO dataset, we employed DeepSeek as the annotation model. The prompt used during annotation is shown below. For data verification, we assembled an annotation expert team comprising one attending psychiatrist and two master's degree students in relevant fields (all members completed specialized training and passed consistency testing). We strictly adhered to the definitions of the emotion classification system proposed by Ekman. During the decision-making process, when the annotations of the three experts diverged, the case was submitted to the psychiatrist for arbitration. The final annotation was determined through internal team discussion. To ensure internal consistency, we randomly selected 10\% of the samples for re-annotation by the entire team to calculate the Kappa coefficient. If the coefficient was low, the team discussed and updated the annotation standards.

|------------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Dialogue history: Input of the seeker:"Today, as I was leaving for work in the morning, I had a tire burst in the middle of a busy road. That scared the hell out of me!"。 Final response: Are you fine now? | Dialogue history: Emotional analysis of last turn's dialogue: This is the first turn of dialogue. Input of the seeker:"Today, as I was leaving for work in the morning, I had a tire burst in the middle of a busy road. That scared the hell out of me!"。 Input analysis: Currently, seeker's cognition of this input is not distorted, but the seeker experienced a feeling of moderate fear. Constraints for response objective: The current seeker's emotional intensity is within normal range. Your objective is to respond with an emotional intensity roughly equivalent to his/her own, maintaining empathy and a sense of being understood while incorporating appropriate exploration and guidance. Thinking Process: Step 1: Analyze dialogue history. Since this is the first turn of dialogue, there is no need to analyze past logic; skip this step directly. Step 2: Understand the semantic meaning of the seeker's input and analyze his/her current cognitive and emotion. The seeker input describes a specific event: a tire blowout occurred on a busy road during the morning commute, causing the seeker to feel intense fear. Semantically, the event itself is characterized by suddenness and danger(the blowout occurred on a busy road). The seeker's cognition is not distorted and can objectively describe the event. However, emotionally, they experienced "moderate fear," which is directly related to the event's potential risks(e.g., safety incidents). The causal relationship is clear: the tire blowout, as an external stimulus, triggered the seeker's fear-a reasonable stress response. Step 3: Define the response objective. Given the constraint that the seeker's emotional intensity is moderate fear, the response must maintain equivalent emotional intensity, avoiding excessive exaggeration or downplaying.The core objective should be care. Step 4: Generate an empathetic response. Based on the preceding analysis, the response should gently inquire about the current safety status while demonstrating concern for the subsequent situation. Final response: Are you fine now? |
| 2 | Dialogue history: seeker:"Today, as I was leaving for work in the morning, I had a tire burst in the middle of a busy road. That scared the hell out of me!" supporter:"Are you fine now?" Input of the seeker:"Yeah, I'm doing alright now, but with minor injuries."。 Final response: Cool:) Is your car damaged a lot? | Dialogue history: seeker:"Today, as I was leaving for work in the morning, I had a tire burst in the middle of a busy road. That scared the hell out of me!" supporter:"Are you fine now?" Emotional analysis of last turn's dialogue: In the last conversation, the seeker felt fear. Input of the seeker:"Yeah, I'm doing alright now, but with minor injuries." Input analysis: Currently, the seeker's cognition of this input is not distorted, and no emotions have been generated. Constraints for response objective: The current seeker's emotional intensity is within normal range. Your objective is to respond with an emotional intensity roughly equivalent to his/her own, maintaining empathy and a sense of being understood while incorporating appropriate exploration and guidance. Thinking Process: Step 1: Analyze dialogue history. In the dialogue history, the seeker described the terrifying experience of a tire blowout and expressed feelings of fear. The supporter responded with concern, asking if the seeker was okay. This indicates the dialogue logic: the seeker shares a traumatic event, and the supporter provides emotional support while checking on the seeker's current state. Step 2: Understand the semantic meaning of the seeker's input and analyze his/her current cognitive and emotion. The seeker's current input,"Yeah, I'm doing alright now, but with minor injuries," semantically indicates recovery from fear with a generally stable condition, though accompanied by minor injuries. Cognitively, the seeker objectively assesses their situation without distortion. Emotionally, intensity is normal, trending toward calm with no significant fluctuations. Step 3: Define the response objective. The response goal is: to respond with an emotional intensity matching the seeker's current state(calm), demonstrating empathy and understanding while gently probing injury details without excessive intervention. Step 4: Generate an empathetic response. Based on the above, the response should first acknowledge the seeker's recovery. Logically building on the dialogue history, it should focus on the seeker's current situation. Final response: Cool:) Is your car damaged a lot? |
| 3 | Dialogue history: Input of the seeker:"A few weeks ago, I was walking through my hallway, minding my own business, when all of a sudden a hand reached out from under a table and grabbed my weeks ago, I was walking thought I was got. Turns out, it was my son." Final response: That's funny, hope he didn't give you a heart attack. | Dialogue history: Emotional analysis of last turn's dialogue: This is the first turn of dialogue. Input of the seeker:"A few weeks ago, I was walking through my hallway, minding my own business, when all of a sudden a hand reached out from under a table and grabbed my ankle. I was so surprised. I thought I was got. Turns out, it was my son."。 Input analysis: Currently, seeker's cognition of this input is not distorted, but the seeker experienced a feeling of moderate joy. Constraints for response objective: The current seeker's emotional intensity is within normal range. Your objective is to respond with an emotional intensity roughly equivalent to his/her own, maintaining empathy and a sense of being understood while incorporating appropriate exploration and guidance. Thinking Process: Step 1: Analyze dialogue history. Since this is the first turn of dialogue, skip this step. Step 2: Understand the semantic meaning of the seeker's input and analyze his/her current cognitive and emotion. The seeker describes an event from several weeks ago: While walking down a hallway, a hand suddenly grabbed his ankle from beneath a table. Initially startled and fearing danger, he relaxed upon realizing it was his son's prank. Semantically, this is a personal narrative shifting from fright to humor, highlighting the playful nature of family interactions. Cognitively, the seeker narrates objectively without distortion, demonstrating rational perspective. Emotionally, the seeker experienced moderate joy stemming from the unexpected delight and familial warmth of the outcome. The causal chain is: the surprise triggered initial shock, which transformed into joy upon revealing the son's identity. Step 3: Define the response objective. Given the seeker's current emotional intensity (moderate joy, within normal range), the response goal is: to reply with comparable emotional intensity(lighthearted, joyful) while expressing empathy and understanding, making the seeker feel accepted. Simultaneously, incorporate gentle guidance(e.g., encouraging sharing more family anecdotes to reinforce positive emotions), avoiding excessive intervention to maintain natural conversation flow. Step 4: Generate an empathetic response. Using the above information, formulate a response plan: Begin with resonance, acknowledging the seeker's joy(e.g., expressing amusement or relief), then explore the event through questions(e.g., about the son's reaction or the seeker's subsequent feelings). Logically, the response must be coherent, transitioning from understanding to exploration, ensuring alignment with the seeker's emotional state. Final response: That's funny, hope he didn't give you a heart attack. |
